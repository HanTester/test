"""This is where the bulk of MacTerm is initialized, but it's best to run it
indirectly by using the "./MacTerm" script (which sets all the library paths).

This Python code relies on compiled C++ routines from MacTerm, which are in
the module "quills".  Most Python code is in the "pymacterm" module, and any of
it may require "quills" in order to work.

When the MacTerm GUI runs, the event loop prevents normal flow of Python code.
So, "quills" relies heavily on callbacks: functions can be defined ahead of time
in Python, registered according to their purpose, and used only when they're
needed.

This exposure to Python simplifies debugging, and gives you extensibility and
configuration options that most applications lack!  This file shows just a few
examples of what you can do...look for more information at MacTerm.net.

    # User-Defined Customizations Module "customize_macterm"
    #
    # If your default Python path includes this module name, then the module
    # will be imported automatically!  And, any functions it defines that match
    # a known protocol will be called.  This allows "cleaner" customization,
    # because you can affect the behavior of this startup code without actually
    # editing the file (MacTerm upgrades will also be smoother).
    #
    # Although the path usually contains many directories, the following choice
    # will probably work best:
    #     /Library/Python/2.x/site-packages/customize_macterm.py
    # NOTE: The path includes the interpreter version, which changes across OS
    #       upgrades.  It is also possible that the new Python version won't
    #       like your code.  Expect to relocate and possibly update your code
    #       after each major OS upgrade.
    #
    # USER CUSTOMIZATIONS PROTOCOL REFERENCE
    #
    # Your customizations may assume that "quills" is properly imported.
    #
    # The following user customizations are defined.  If you do not want to use
    # something, just leave it out; but what you do define must EXACTLY match
    # what is expected in this file, or MacTerm may have problems starting up!
    # (If you see a failure, run the Console application to help debug.)
    #
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # app_will_finish()
    #
    # Since running the main event loop prevents Python from ever returning to
    # this script, anything that should happen "after" must be in a callback
    # that is automatically executed.
    #
    # One way to think of it is as if the program has two "halves"; the first
    # half is up to the end of the event loop; the second half is everything
    # afterward, and the second half must be in this function.
    #
    # The Base.all_done() function is automatically called after your function
    # returns.
    #
    # EXAMPLE
    #     def app_will_finish():
    #         print("this is the 2nd half of my script")
    #
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # initial_workspace() -> string
    #
    # Return the UTF-8-encoded name to pass as the "initial_workspace" keyword
    # parameter for Base.all_init().  Any Prefs.WORKSPACE collection name will
    # override the Default and cause a different set of windows to be spawned.
    # If not defined or not found, the Default is used anyway.
    #
    # If you just want to set this to a static value, you're advised to use the
    # Preferences window, and just edit the Default to do what you want.  The
    # only benefit to setting it here is when you want to do something dynamic;
    # for instance, you could check to see if the computer's host name indicates
    # a VPN connection, and spawn different startup sessions in that case.
