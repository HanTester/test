<div class="content">

<a id="helpwithterminalsettings"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

	<h2 id="select">Text Selections</h2>

	<p>Highlight terminal text by dragging over it with the mouse.  Keep
 it <strong>rectangular</strong> by holding down the Option key.</p>

	<p>Text selections can often be initiated from the keyboard by
 holding down the Shift key and pressing arrow keys.</p>

	<h3 id="selectdrag">Drag and Drop</h3>

	<p>The Unix pathnames of files or folders can be typed by dropping
 one or more icons (from the Finder, say) into a terminal.  Spaces
 are automatically escaped by backslashes, and each dropped item&#8217;s
 pathname is followed by two spaces so that it is easy to read all
 paths and construct a command line.</p>

	<p>Text can be copied by using the mouse to move a selection to
 another location &#8211; for instance, the Desktop (to make a text
 clipping).</p>

	<p>Text can be imported in the same way &#8211; any text dropped into a
 terminal is effectively typed into the terminal.  MacTerm will
 handle the inserted text in exactly the same way that it handles
 a Paste command.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Multi-line text may trigger an alert if you have not set the
 &#8220;Don&#8217;t warn about multi-line Paste&#8221; General preference.  If the
 text is pasted normally, it will first be modified to respect
 the new-line definition of the session; then, each new line may
 be delayed if a &#8220;Line Insertion Delay&#8221; Data Flow preference has
 been set for the session.  See <a href="preferences.html">the Preferences page</a>
 for more on these settings.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h3 id="selectappearance">Text Selection Preferences</h3>

	<p>See <a href="preferences.html">the Preferences page</a> for some options related to the
 appearance and behavior of text selections.  For instance, you
 can choose to have them automatically copied to the clipboard.</p>

	<h2 id="termsearch">Terminal Search</h2>

<a id="helpsearchingfortext"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

	<p>The Edit &gt;&gt; Find&#8230; command allows <strong>dynamic</strong> search of the entire
 contents of a terminal (main screen and scrollback).  The dialog
 has a special minimalist design so that it won&#8217;t cover any search
 results.</p>

	<p>As you type, every match for the forming pattern is immediately
 found and highlighted, in a special way that does not cancel any
 other text selection in the window.  In addition, red tick marks
 appear on the scroll bar, showing you where you can find even
 more matches in the scrollback buffer.</p>

	<p>For performance reasons, single-character searches are not
 dynamic, although you can still close the dialog to initiate a
 one-character search.</p>

	<p>The &#8220;A=a&#8221; checkbox, again an abbreviated interface, simply makes
 the search case-insensitive.</p>

	<p>The history menu allows you to access any previously accepted
 queries for the current terminal window.  If you do not use the
 default button when closing a search, your query is discarded and
 any previous search&#8217;s highlighting is restored.</p>

	<p>You can draw attention to individual results in turn by using the
 Edit &gt;&gt; Find Next command (and via modifier key, Find Previous).</p>

	<h3>Auto-Completion</h3>

	<p>You can quickly find words that match either the word nearest the
 cursor or the selected text.  Invoke Edit &gt;&gt; Show Completions (or
 press Option-Escape) to display a menu of matches.  The candidate
 words must appear somewhere in the terminal window or scrollback
 buffer.</p>

	<p>When you select a match from the menu, its text is typed into the
 active terminal window.  If the text at the cursor position
 already contains some portion of the completion text however,
 MacTerm will only &#8220;type&#8221; the remaining portion for you so that
 the result is the complete word.</p>

	<p>Note that, like any menu, the completions menu can be navigated
 using the keyboard (for example: typing letters of an item to
 select it, using arrow keys, or hitting Escape to discard the
 menu).</p>

	<h2>Cursor</h2>

	<p>The cursor is a special position in the bottommost screenful of a
 terminal, representing (usually) where text will appear when you
 type.</p>

	<h3 id="findcursor">Finding the Cursor</h3>

	<p>Use Edit &gt;&gt; Find Cursor to create a homing animation that tells
 you where the terminal cursor is in the active window.  This can
 be useful at times when the cursor is hard to see amongst several
 lines of text.</p>

	<h3 id="cursorappearance">Cursor Preferences</h3>

	<p>See <a href="preferences.html">the Preferences page</a> for some options related to the
 appearance and behavior of the cursor.  For instance, you can
 choose its shape and whether or not it is flashing on and off.</p>

	<h2 id="commandline">Floating Command Line</h2>

<a id="helpusingthefloatingcommandline"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

	<p>Use Window &gt;&gt; Command Line to display a floating window for
 entering text locally.  Unlike typing directly into a terminal,
 nothing you type in the floating window is seen until you press
 the <strong>Return</strong> key (which also sends a new-line sequence to the
 terminal).</p>

	<p>You can use the down-arrow key or the mouse to access a list of
 previously-entered command lines.  The field supports the usual
 Mac editing short-cuts, such as option-left-arrow to skip to the
 previous word.  It also supports some shell-like short-cuts, such
 as control-A and control-E to jump to the beginning and end,
 respectively.</p>

	<p>The colors of the command line are read from your Default Format
 preferences when the window is first displayed.</p>

	<h2>Window Operations</h2>

	<p>MacTerm provides many sophisticated ways to manage windows.</p>

	<h3 id="dimensions">Screen Sizes</h3>

<a id="helpsettingthescreensize"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

	<p>Some applications that run in terminals will either assume one of
 a few standard sizes, or have issues at certain (typically large)
 sizes; for instance, text editors may run out of memory with wide
 terminals.  While MacTerm does not restrict your window size,
 it does provide a few short-cut commands to let you immediately
 change to common sizes (80&#215;24, 80&#215;40, 132&#215;24).</p>

	<p>You may also open a dialog to choose a specific number of rows
 and columns.  Note that Edit &gt;&gt; Undo can be used to cancel
 dimension changes made with these commands.</p>

	<p>If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can hold down the Option
 key and use the wheel to increase or decrease the terminal rows
 (or terminal columns, if your wheel can be moved horizontally).
 You can also adjust terminal columns by holding down both the
 Option and Command keys when using the vertical scroll wheel.</p>

	<p>Set the &#8220;Window Resize Effect&#8221; to &#8220;Terminal screen size&#8221; in the
 Preferences window if you want ordinary window resizes to
 automatically change the screen dimensions.  Note that you can
 temporarily invert this preference (to set the font size instead)
 by holding down the Control key while you resize a window.  And
 when you use &#8220;Enter Full Screen&#8221; you can hold down the Option key
 to change the resizing behavior of full-screen terminals.</p>

	<h3 id="magnify">Magnification</h3>

	<p>Use View &gt;&gt; Make Text as Big as Possible to alter a terminal&#8217;s
 text size based on the display that contains the largest part of
 its window!</p>

	<p>If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can hold down the Control
 key and use the wheel to increase or decrease the text size.</p>

	<p>Set the &#8220;Window Resize Effect&#8221; to &#8220;Text size&#8221; in the Preferences
 window if you want ordinary window resizes to automatically
 change the font size.  Note that you can temporarily invert this
 preference (to set the terminal screen size instead) by holding
 down the Control key while you resize a window.  And when you
 use &#8220;Enter Full Screen&#8221; you can hold down the Option key to
 change the resizing behavior of full-screen terminals.</p>

	<p>Note that Edit &gt;&gt; Undo can be used to cancel dimension changes
 made with the &#8220;Make Text&#8230;&#8221; commands.</p>

	<h3 id="hide">Hiding Windows</h3>

	<p>A window can be hidden from view while it is still open, allowing
 you to reduce clutter without disturbing active commands or
 remote connections.  Note that if you Option-click another window
 the active terminal will automatically hide before activating the
 new window.</p>

	<h3 id="arrange">Arranging Windows</h3>

	<p>When arranged, <em>all</em> terminal windows return to a diagonal
 stagger pattern that matches their original opening positions.
 <span class="caps">NOTE</span> that this cannot be undone.</p>

	<h3 id="sessionwinch">Session-Induced Window Changes</h3>

	<p>MacTerm respects some of XTerm&#8217;s window sequences, so a terminal
 application may also affect a window.  Typically an application
 will rename the window or minimize it into the Dock.</p>
