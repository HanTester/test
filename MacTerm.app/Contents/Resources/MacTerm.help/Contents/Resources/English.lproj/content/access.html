	<h2 id="servers">Remote Sessions: Connecting to Servers</h2>

	<p>Select File &gt;&gt; Custom New Session&#8230; to begin.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Only your first sessions should require this
 customization step.  In the future, it will be faster
 to rely on a Favorite or a saved session file to hold
 your preferences.  A Favorite can be opened directly
 from the File menu; for others, use File &gt;&gt; Open.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>A Custom New Session opens a terminal window and a sheet to allow
 configuration.</p>

	<p>This sheet is identical to the equivalent panel of the Preferences
 window, so just review the <a href="preferences.html#sessionresource">preferences documentation</a> for more.</p>

	<p>Unlike Preferences, changes to the sheet are temporary and can
 be either discarded or committed using the sheet&#8217;s buttons.</p>

	<h2 id="unix">Local Sessions: Running Unix Commands</h2>

	<p>As with remote applications, File &gt;&gt; Open&#8230; can be used to run a
 command that you previously saved.</p>

	<p>You have a few options for new commands:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>File &gt;&gt; Shell opens your default Unix shell, where you can type commands interactively.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>File &gt;&gt; Default (or the name of any other Favorite from your Session Preferences) in the &#8220;New Session:&#8221; section of the File menu, will open that session.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>File &gt;&gt; Custom New Session&#8230; can also be used; simply ignore the &#8220;Remote Shell&#8230;&#8221; button, and enter command line text.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Hold down Option to see File &gt;&gt; Log-In Shell.  This invokes a shell in log-in mode (with shell-dependent settings) that will not inherit any environment variable settings from MacTerm.</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Most session creation commands are also available
 from the MacTerm icon&#8217;s Dock menu.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2 id="workspaces">Workspaces: Starting Several Sessions</h2>

	<p>Using Preferences, you can define Workspaces, which specify a set
 of sessions that should all start at the same time, in a certain
 window arrangement.</p>

	<p>Once a workspace is defined, go to the &#8220;New From Workspace:&#8221;
 section of the File menu, and use File &gt;&gt; Default (or the name of
 any other Favorite from your Workspace Preferences), to create
 the sessions of a workspace.</p>

	<h2 id="dupwin">Replicating Windows</h2>

	<p>You can use File &gt;&gt; Duplicate Session to spawn a new window that
 is running the same command as the previous window.</p>

	<p>Currently, only the command is duplicated; other window settings
 may come from your defaults.  Once a window is duplicated, any
 updates to the window will not affect its duplicate.</p>

	<h2 id="restart">Restarting Commands</h2>

	<p>If the &#8220;No window close on process exit&#8221; preference is set, a
 session window will remain open when it quits by itself (that is,
 if it was not explicitly terminated using File &gt;&gt; Close or your
 mouse).  When the window is in this dead state, the special
 File &gt;&gt; Restart Session command becomes available.</p>

	<p>When you restart a session, the original local or remote command
 line is run again in the same window, preserving your entire
 scrollback buffer and other window settings.  Most programs do
 not aggressively save their state, so a restart is unlikely to
 let you simply resume where the program left off when it last
 exited.</p>
