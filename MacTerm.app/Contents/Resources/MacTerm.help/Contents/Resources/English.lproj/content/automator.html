<div class="content">

	<p id="abstract">MacTerm support for Automator is currently limited, however
 there are ways to use existing actions that you may not have
 realized.</p>

	<h2 id="urls">Opening Sessions With URLs</h2>

	<p>The default Internet actions in Automator (Mac OS X 10.4+) are
 often named or described in terms of web pages, but in fact they
 are general: opening sessions for URLs that MacTerm supports.</p>

	<p>A simple workflow in Automator would be to connect (from the
 Internet category) &#8220;Get Specified URLs&#8221; to &#8220;Display Webpages&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Automator will call on MacTerm if MacTerm is the default
 application for a particular type of <span class="caps">URL</span>.  Otherwise, different
 applications will handle the <span class="caps">URL</span>.  (3rd party software such as
 &#8220;Default Apps&#8221; can change the <span class="caps">URL</span> mappings on your system.)</p>

	<p>MacTerm can handle several kinds of URLs, including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>file</li>
		<li>ftp</li>
		<li>rlogin</li>
		<li>sftp (non-standard)</li>
		<li>ssh (non-standard)</li>
		<li>telnet</li>
		<li>x-man-page (non-standard)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It is also possible to add or change <span class="caps">URL</span> handlers, through the
 lower-level Python <span class="caps">API</span> in MacTerm.  For instance, you could add
 a handler that runs a terminal-based browser for &#8220;http&#8221; URLs.</p>
