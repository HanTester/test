"""Routines to open MacTerm sessions using information in URLs.

Below, example URLs fully specify all parts, although each type
has a number of optional parts that may be omitted (e.g. user
and port, man page section).

file -- handle URLs of the form "file:///path/to/some/file"
ftp -- handle URLs of the form "ftp://user@host:port"
rlogin -- handle URLs of the form "rlogin://user@host:port"
sftp -- handle URLs of the form "sftp://user@host:port"
ssh -- handle URLs of the form "ssh://user@host:port"
telnet -- handle URLs of the form "telnet://user@host:port"
x_man_page -- handle URLs of the form "x-man-page://section/cmd"
