<h2>Host Directory</h2><p>

The host directory can be accessed from the File menu and acts as a personal 
host directory for commonly used hosts and their settings.&nbsp;</p><p> 
The main window lets you select one or more hosts to call and functions 
to make connections or to maintain the list of hosts.&nbsp;</p><p> 
The <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_PHONE_OPTS.html>Options button</a> near the bottom of the address book 
can be used to manage the sections and to configure list display. You can also 
create multiple folders inside each of the sections (right mouse button).&nbsp;</p><p> 
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> 
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Connect</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Connects to one or more selected entries (you can select more than one entry 
by holding the Ctrl key pressed while you click on one entry after the other). 
<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If multiple entries are selected, the action taken depends on the settings 
in the individual host directory entries. Entries can be configured to 
open a new tab or new window and entries are also configured to either 
use a dialog with retry-option to connect or to just make the connection 
without showing a dialog.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
ZOC will try to launch parallel connections to as many hosts possible, 
but because the program can only show one AutoConnect dialog at a time, 
depending on the combination of entries and depending on their settings, 
ZOC will sometimes queue hosts to be called later via the <font color="5080A0"><i>Call Next</i></font> 
function from the File menu. If you want to avoid queuing, set the hosts 
to open a new tab or window and/or use the SimpleConnect feature 
(in the <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_PHONE_EDIT_MAIN.html>Host</a> tab of the individual entries).
