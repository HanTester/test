<h2>AutoConnect</h2><p>

The AutoConnect function is used when you select the connect function from the 
<a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_PHONE_MAIN.html>Host Directory</a> It only applies to host directory items, 
that have the <font color="5080A0"><i>AutoConnect</i></font> feature selected. This feature is mainly intended 
for modem/ISDN connections..&nbsp;</p><p> 
The feature tries to connect you to a given host and possibly retries several times 
if it fails to make a connection. You can specify the maximum number of retries 
and the time between trials of the <b>same</b> phone number. If, for example, you set 
the time between attempts to 10 seconds and select three entries from 
the host directory to be called, and if the call to all of them fails, the first 
one will be called immediately after the third since trying the second 
and the third will very likely need more 10 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p> 
Some countries require some time to pass before the next number 
can be dialed. So ZOC lets you define the minimum time between tries 
to call <b>any</b> number.&nbsp;</p><p> 
Additionally you can define a string to be used as a prefix 
for calls via Modem/Serial or ISDN connections. This is useful 
if you have to dial 0 or 9 to get a dial tone. If you need the prefix 
only for the Modem/Serial handler, you can use the modem dial commands 
(see <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_MODEMAT.html>Modem Options</a>) or the phone number 
macros (see below) for this purpose.

You can choose between a large and a small window that shows the progress 
and details while calling. The large window (naturally) covers more screen 
while the smaller one might not fully display long messages or phone numbers 
(which is just a cosmetic problem). 
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Note: </b>You can switch between the larger and the smaller window while calling 
by clicking the minimize/maximize buttons in the upper right corner of the 
AutoConnect window.

&nbsp;<br/><table class="hlbox" width="99%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr class="hlbox"><td class="hlbox"><b>DIAL MACROS</b></td></tr></table><img src="dummy.gif" alt="nil" width="200" height="12" /><br/> 
The host directory offers four special macros for use with telephone numbers. 
When you use the strings $1, $2, $3 or $4 somewhere in a telephone number 
(or other device's equivalent) ZOC replaces the string with the text defined 
in the Macros dialog.&nbsp;</p><p> 
E.g. if you are using calling card numbers for some entries in your 
host directory, you could define $1 as 1234 5678 9012 3456 and insert $1 into 
your phone number where ever the calling card number should appear. 
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Note: </b>These macros are strictly for use with telephone numbers in the phone 
book. They do not work if you use them in modem strings, function keys, etc. 
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Note: </b>In many cases similar results can be achieved by the use of 
different dialing strings (see <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_MODEMAT.html>Modem Options</a>).
