Select various parts of the program that should be protected by a password, 
because they are likely to contain confidential information.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
There is also an option to lock the program if there was no keyboard input 
for some time. This works across multiple ZOC windows, i.e. the program 
will lock only you did not use the keyboard with any of the open ZOC windows.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
Likewise, the password to protect the program window only needs to be entered for 
the first ZOC window and will not be requested if another ZOC window is also open 
and locked.
