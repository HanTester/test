<h2>Serial/Modem and Serial/Direct Overview</h2><p>

This section applies to two similar connection types: <font color="5080A0"><i>Serial/Modem</i></font> and <font color="5080A0"><i>Serial/Direct</i></font>&nbsp;</p><p> 
The purpose of Serial/Direct is to connect to gear which is hooked directly to 
the serial port of your machine, e.g. routers, flash programming devices and such.&nbsp;</p><p> 
The Serial/Modem method should be used to dial out to a remote location using a 
modem which is attached to the serial port and where the modem is controlled through 
means of AT-commands (e.g. <font color="5080A0"><i>ATDT &lt;number&gt;</i></font> to dial). &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> 
The two are similar in that they work through serial ports and have almost the same 
options, but there are two basic differences between Serial/Modem and Serial/Direct: <br> 
1) Serial/Modem will internally issue AT commands to the attached port in order 
to configure the modem it and to let it make the connection. Serial/Direct does not 
send any commands or text strings by itself.<br> 
2) Serial/Modem will operate under the assumption that 'connection' refers to a connection 
to a remote location which the modem has made (not connecting to the serial port talking 
to the modem itself). With Serial/Direct however, 'connection' means opening the serial 
port in order to exchange data with the attached device itself.

For details about how to connect to a remote host via ZOC's Serial/Modem and/or 
how to use Serial/Direct to talk to devices which are attached directly to a serial 
port, please follow the instructions in <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_QUICKSTART.html>Quick Start Guides</a>
