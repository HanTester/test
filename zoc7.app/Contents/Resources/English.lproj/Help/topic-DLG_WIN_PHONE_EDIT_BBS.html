If ZOC finds a carrier detect signal after calling a host, it will 
update the date of last call for the called entries (and all others that are 
equal to the one that was called in the first six characters of the name, 
thus managing multi-line hosts correctly, see Name-field above). <br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If you want to call a host regularly (say once a week) you can enter the 
number of days here after which ZOC should remind you (by showing a symbol 
in front of the phone number in the main window) that it is time to call 
that host again.

Many bulletin board systems offer a method called IEMSI to automate 
the login procedure.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
Using this method you can provide your name in the IEMSI options 
window and set the password field to the password you use to log into that 
host. Additionally you can specify some options that are used by host.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
During the login the host will send the IEMSI request (**IEMSI_IRQ; 
not to be mixed up with the **EMSI_REQ that is used for FIDO mailer software) 
to which ZOC responds by sending your user name and password to the 
host. If everything goes well, the host will let you in at once and 
show (or skip) news, new mail and new files as selected in the IEMSI 
options window.<br>
