<h2>Emulation Options</h2><p>

This window is used to select and configure the emulation. It can be opened via menu or 
by clicking on the emulation button in the status line. The selected emulation and its 
options will be used as long as no other part of the program overrides it.&nbsp;</p><p> 
For example, if the session profile is assigned to a <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_PHONE_EDIT.html>Host Directory Entry</a>, 
the entry itself can yet activate a different emulation. The entry can also choose to 
use or to override the session profile's options for that particular emulation.&nbsp;</p><p> 
Specific keys of each emulation can be mapped to different PC-keys. This is done 
by using <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_APXEMUKEYS.html>Emulation Specific Key Names</a> in conjunction with 
<a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_KEYBOARD.html>Options&rarr;Keyboard Profiles</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>

Todays most widely used emulation in the Unix/Linux world. 
The emulation supports most of the available pc-keys as well as color, 
international characters and it also offers a couple of other advanced

The ANSI Emulation is mostly used in BBSs. It is main feature 
is that it uses the IBM-PC graphic character set and allows to display text 
in different colors. For compatibility with the FIDO ANSI-BBS standard, 
it also supports all VT102 control codes. Under Unix it is commonly referred 
to as <font color="5080A0"><i>TERM=pcansi</i></font>

ZOC does support 3270 extended color coding and also offers a range of predefined 
color styles for non-extended sessions. You can also 
find an options file (OPTIONS\3270.zoc) that provides user buttons 
for some common and some unmapped keys.

The 5250 emulation is used with IBM iSeries eServer (former AS/400). 
The emulation needs to be used with Telnet connections (this combination 
is commonly known as TN5250). The key definitions are described 
in <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_APX5250KEYS.html>5250 keyboard mapping</a>. You can also 
map other special keys to other places on the keyboard or to user buttons

This emulation is the preferred emulation on Sun Solaris

VT102 is mostly used in Unix environments and is compatible 
with the (slightly inferior) VT100 standard. VT102 is a simple all purpose 
choice. It does not support colors or extended keys except F1-F4, 
so you should try to use <font color="5080A0"><i>vt220</i></font> instead. Under Unix it is known as 
<font color="5080A0"><i>TERM=vt100</i></font> or <font color="5080A0"><i>TERM=vt102</i></font>

VT220 Terminals are a major improvement over VT102 and a good 
starting point if you not know what emulation to choose.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
VT220 supports most of the keys found on a PC keyboard (please check 
<a class="link" href=topic-HLP_APXVT100KEYS.html>VTxxx keyboard mapping</a>) and it supports national 
character sets in a consistent way. However there is no official support for colors. 
Almost all Unix systems should support his emulation if you set 
<font color="5080A0"><i>TERM=vt220</i></font> 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1">
VT52 is a very old standard from DEC and is hardly used

With Telnet and SSH connection, ZOC will report your current 
emulation to the remote host, which usually will store it in the 
TERM= environment variable for use with termcaps/terminfo applications. 
All ZOC emulations have a built in TERM string (as indicated in the 
above list) that will work on almost all such systems. However, if 
you need Telnet or SSH to report a custom term type identifier 
to the remote host, you can enter it here. If you are not sure 
what this means, please leave this option off.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br>

In VT102 mode the numeric key pad is used as a replacement for VT102 auxiliary 
keypad (see <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_APXVT100KEYS.html>VT102-keyboard</a>). This can be problematic 
if you are using the cursor keys in the numeric keypad instead of the gray 
cursor keys. Enable this option, if you want to use the cursor keys in the 
numeric keypad and if your remote application does not use the VT102 keypad.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br>
