<h2>Common Problems and Questions (Trouble Shooting Guide)</h2><p>

&nbsp;</p><p>Please also read <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_QUICKSTART.html>Quick Start Guides</a> for 
step by step instructions on how to make connections with Telnet, SSH, 
ISDN etc. And see the <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_APXHOWTO.html>How-To Guide</a>.&nbsp;</p><p> 
If you do not find a solution to a problem below, please visit our web site and ask 
your question via the support request form. 
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> 
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>ZOC tries to access the com port or complains about RTS/CTS when starting</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
This happens when <font color="5080A0"><i>Serial/Modem</i></font> is set as your default connection type in the session profile. 
Please go to <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_DEVICE.html>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Connection Type</a>, then change the 
connection type to Telnet, SSH or your preferred method of communication and 
save the session profile.

<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
ZOC tries to find a matching host name for IP addresses. If you 
do not have name server entries for your connections, this may take a few seconds. 
To disable the feature, go to <font color="5080A0"><i>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Connection Type&rarr;Telnet&rarr;Global Options</i></font>

<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>The transparency option slows down the computer</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
In order to make use of the transparency, you need an up-to-date video board. 
Otherwise the system's processor will have to perform the necessary graphical 
computations for the transparency effect. If you have an older video board, 
please disable the option in <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_WINDOW.html>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Window</a> 
and/or <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_WINDOW.html>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Window</a>.

<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>The selected emulation displays messed up screens</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Please make sure that the chosen emulation is suitable for the remote host. 
Via Telnet and SSH the ZOC emulation is automatically communicated to the remote 
host, so just try to select a different one. <font color="5080A0"><i>Xterm</i></font>, <font color="5080A0"><i>VT220</i></font> or 
<font color="5080A0"><i>VT102</i></font> will work well on many systems, although some systems require 
quite specific and sometimes arcane choices.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If you are using another terminal emulator that works well on your system, 
check its options and see which emulation is used there.

Please activate the <font color="5080A0"><i>UTF8/Unicode</i></font> support in the Emulation options 
for the Linux emulation (try Xterm/Linux/VT220), or choose the <font color="5080A0"><i>UTF8/Unicode</i></font> 
character set in <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_LAYOUT.html>Session Profile, Layout</a> 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>My emulation basically works, but it shows funny characters instead of line-graphics/boxes</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Go to <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_LAYOUT.html>Session Profile, Layout</a> and either try the 
<font color="5080A0"><i>UTF8/Unicode</i></font> or the <font color="5080A0"><i>IBM/DOS</i></font> character set. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Some F-Keys do not work with my remote system</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Please make sure that you are using an emulation which supports the 
full range of F-Keys (e.g. <font color="5080A0"><i>Xterm</i></font>, <font color="5080A0"><i>VT220</i></font>, <font color="5080A0"><i>Sun CDE</i></font>, <font color="5080A0"><i>Ansi SCO</i></font> 
or <font color="5080A0"><i>Linux</i></font>).<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
Other emulations only support a limited number of f-keys, in that case you 
will have to map the correct values (if you know what your host expects) 
for the f-keys yourself in the <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_KEYBOARD.html>Options&rarr;Keyboard Profiles</a> dialog. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>The cursor keys do not work in some VT102/VT220 applications</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
You should use the gray cursor keys, not the numeric keypad. The keypad 
is used for other purposes by some remote applications. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Keyboard redefinition does not work</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Please note that the keyboard redefinition takes the Num-Lock state into 
account. Check your <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_KEYBOARD.html>Options&rarr;Keyboard Profiles</a> and see if 
your keys are mapped depending on the Num-Lock and Scroll-Lock states. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>I cannot connect using Windows-Modems (TAPI)</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
ZOC does not use Window's Local Settings, which means that you have to 
type the phone number exactly as you want it to be dialed (including 
digits to get an outside line or to dial long distance). 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>ZOC cannot open the COM port while other programs can</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Please make sure that the COM port is available by typing 
<font class="example" color="207030" face="Courier New"><span class="example">MODE COMx</span></font> (where x is the number of the port) at a command prompt.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If this does not result in an error message, make sure that you typed 
the com port's name correctly in ZOC. Especially do not use space 
characters between COM and the number. With higher port numbers (above COM10), 
some systems require the format <font color="5080A0"><i>\\.\COMxx</i></font><br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
The error could also appear if the port is currently used by another program. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>I keep getting a "No CTS from modem" message</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
To prevent ZOC and the modem to overrun each others buffers at times, both 
should be configured to support the so called RTS/CTS handshake. This 
is especially necessary with transfer speeds of 9600 bps and more. <br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If you have activated RTS/CTS handshake, ZOC insists on getting the according 
signal from the modem, because without this signal the communication will be blocked. 
Hence ZOC issues a warning if the CTS signal from the modem cannot be detected. <br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If you get this warning, please check that your modem is configured 
to supply the CTS command (e.g. by using the modem's factory settings), 
that you are using a 7-wire cable (and adapter) between the modem and the PC and 
that you are using the correct COM-port in <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_DEVICE.html>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Connection Type</a> 
and/or in <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_PHONE_EDIT.html>Host Directory&rarr;Edit</a> <br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If the modem or attached device does not support RTS/CTS, turn off RTS/CTS 
handshake by clicking the Configure button for Serial/Modem or Serial/Direct. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Zmodem file transfers via telnet fail</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Please try different Telnet-options in <font color="5080A0"><i>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Connection Type</i></font>, 
or <font color="5080A0"><i>Host Directory&rarr;Edit&rarr;Connection Type&rarr;Configure</i></font>

<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Try to use the -e, -eb or -v option on Unix's side:

&nbsp;</p><p>If your connection is routed through a Xyplex concentrator, there currently 
is no known method to make Zmodem uploads at all. You will have to use another 
protocol -- best choice in this case is probably CKERMIT used from a transfer 
shell from ZOC (please search the help file for CKERMIT to get details). 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Downloads generally work fine, but modem uploads of large files fail</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Probably you are using a high-speed modem but have RTS/CTS disabled. For 
high-speed transmission both, the modem and ZOC, need to be configured 
to use RTS/CTS handshaking.

<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>After downloads the time setting of files is off by a few hours</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Please check the discussion of the TZ environment variable in the

<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Whenever I leave the program I get a Carrier Detect warning</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Maybe your modem is configured to have the CD signal always on. Set it 
to match the CD state (maybe AT&C1) or set the CD signal to 'invalid' 
in the serial options. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Sometimes ZOC hangs after starting or when sending to the COM port</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Try to disable DSR handshake in the options for Serial/Modem.

<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>My modem works properly with other terminal software but not with ZOC</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Try using the same modem initialization as in the other terminal package. 
Or store that modem configuration into the non-volatile memory of the 
modem (mostly done with AT&W) and use ATZ as the initialization string 
for ZOC (AT commands are configured from the Serial/Modem device settings). 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>ZOC does not show ISDN as a Connection Type under Windows</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
You need CAPI V2.0 drivers from your board manufacturer, which come with 
nearly all of the better ISDN cards. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>ISDN can be selected, but connections fail</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
You are probably using a CAPI2032.DLL which does not work with your current 
drivers, e.g. CAPI2032.DLL from Windows, together with drivers from your board. 
Also, please set the communication parameters to STANDARD (there is a <font color="5080A0"><i>Standard</i></font> button 
in <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_DEVICE.html>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Connection Type&rarr;ISDN</a>) and save the options. <br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
Also make sure, that this kind of setting is made in all your ISDN phone 
book entries. If you still experience problems, please try to reinstall your ISDN 
drivers and make sure that you are using the latest driver kit from your 
manufacturer. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>No characters appear after making a modem connection</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
You use a secured transmission and the modem waits to get an OK signal 
from the computer which does not come. Turn on RTS/CTS in the options for the 
serial connection. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Sizing the ZOC window only works in large steps</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
By default ZOC changes the font size when you size the window. Since the 
font is not available in every necessary size ZOC will use a best-fit 
method and size the window accordingly. If you do not like this, you can 
change the sizing behavior in the 
<a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_WINDOW.html>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Window</a> options. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>I would like to use more fonts for ZOC</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
ZOC checks all available fonts in the system to find the ones that could 
be used for the terminal window. For use in ZOC all characters in the 
font must have the same width and must support the selected code page.<br> 
Under Windows the Courier New, Lucida Console and Terminal fonts meet this 
requirement. If you do not see the Terminal font in ZOC's font list, 
please make sure that the 'Show only true type fonts...' setting in 
<font color="5080A0"><i>My Computer&rarr;Control Panel&rarr;Fonts&rarr;View&rarr;Options&rarr;True Type</i></font> 
is not selected. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>I miss a full screen mode</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
There is no character based full screen mode available. ZOC is a graphical 
program and uses the benefits of the graphical user interface (like offering 
icons). However, you can maximize the ZOC window using the maximize button in 
the title bar. This way ZOC will cover the whole screen (you should select 
a large font if you do this). 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Scrolling is slow</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Scrolling in an window is generally slower than in full screen mode. 
There is a scroll speed option in <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_TERMINAL.html>Options&rarr;Session Profile&rarr;Terminal</a> 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Is there a host mode?</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Yes. It is implemented as a REXX program. To start it select 
Script, Start Script and select MINIHOST.ZRX. The program will prompt you 
for two passwords (for guest and supervisor mode) and will then wait for 
incoming calls. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>What does ZOC mean?</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy might describe ZOC as followed: 
&nbsp;</p><p><b>zoc (v)</b>, to <font class="example" color="207030" face="Courier New"><span class="example">zoc</span></font> means communicating with other people 
through the means of extremely sophisticated hard- and software 
(sophisticated at least from the viewpoint of the ape-descended inhabitants 
of an extremely unimportant blue planet in an even lesser important part of 
the galaxy who think that personal computers are a pretty neat pieces of 
hardware).
