<h2>Serial/Modem and Serial/Direct Options</h2><p>

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> 
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Com-Port</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Enter the name of the communications port in this entry field. This is 
usually a string like <font class="example" color="207030" face="Courier New"><span class="example">COM1</span></font> under Windows (note that there is no space 
between COM and 1) or <font class="example" color="207030" face="Courier New"><span class="example">/dev/cu.pl2303serial</span></font> under Mac OS X. To access com 
ports above COM8 on Windows NT or higher use \\.\COMxx. 
To use remote COM-ports in a Windows Network, a modem sharing tool (e.g. Stomper) 
is required. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Serial Options</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
In this section you define how data is transferred between your computer 
and the modem (which is not necessarily the same way the modem uses to 
transfer data across the telephone line). You have to select a speed 
(bits per second), the number of data bits, a parity mode (none, even, 
odd, mark or space) and the number of stop bits. <br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
What you use depends mostly on your host.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
These settings are often given (e.g. in instructions of how to call a 
host) in an abbreviated version, like 38400-8N1 (38400 bits per second, 
8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit). 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>RTS/CTS handshake</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
If enabled, ZOC uses RTS/CTS hardware handshake for communication with your 
modem.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
RTS/CTS is used to control the flow of data between the computer and the 
modem and provides a way for both to prevent the other from sending 
data.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
This is essential for file transfers when the speed of the modem to modem 
connection is different from the modem to computer connection (which is true 
for MNP5 of V.42 modems). It is also essential in multitasking environments 
where the processor might have other things to do when data 
arrives.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
Thus, it is highly recommended to have this option enabled. However, 
the modem or attached device needs to support it as well, so check your modem 
manual for the proper modem command to "enable bi-directional RTS/CTS hardware flow control" 
for use in the modem init string (see <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_MODEMAT.html>Modem Options</a>). 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>DSR handshake</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
This DSR/DTR handshake is somewhat similar to RTS/CTS. However, it does not 
control the data flow, but the general availability of the modem and computer 
(i.e. if these are turned on).<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If enabled, ZOC monitors the DSR signal for communication with the modem. 
This option should only be enabled if your modem and your cable properly 
provide the DSR signal. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>XON/XOFF</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
If enabled, ZOC uses the Xon/Xoff software handshake for communication (which 
is yet another method to control the data stream). It uses special characters 
to hold/release the sender. This method is inferior to RTS/CTS handshaking 
and should only be used if necessary. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Valid CD signal</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
If your modem supports the Carrier Detect (CD) signal (most modems will do 
this if you add AT&C1 to the modem init string in the 
<a class="link" href=topic-HLP_MODEMAT.html>Modem Options</a>), you should enable this option 
(which is highly recommended). <br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
ZOC uses the CD signal to control the connection timer and other functions 
which depend on if a connection is active or not.. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Break signal duration</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
The duration that is used for sending a break signal (some hosts use 
this to break an operation) when pressing Ctrl+End. It is given in 
milliseconds and typically ranges from 250 to 400 ms. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>AT-Commands</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
The Serial/Modem method lets you create and select multiple profiles 
with AT commands to control modem functions like dial, hangup etc. 
You can select an existing profile, change the 
<a class="link" href=topic-HLP_MODEMAT.html>AT commands</a> or leave the field empty to use 
ZOC's defaults.
