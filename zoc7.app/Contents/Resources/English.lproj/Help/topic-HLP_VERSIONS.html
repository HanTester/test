<h2>ZOC Evaluation and Full Version</h2><p>

&nbsp;</p><p> 
ZOC is a modem and telnet communication program that is available in 
different editions for all Windows 32 bit platforms (95/98/ME and 
Windows NT/2000/XP/2003). 
&nbsp;</p><p> 
To find out which ZOC edition you are using, please check the Product 
Information dialog in the Help menu.

<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
This is the demo version of ZOC which you may evaluate for 30 days. 
No features are missing or disabled, but after a few days you will 
receive notification windows about the fact that the program eventually 
needs to be purchased and the order form is shown after each 
download. <br> 
When you buy ZOC you will receive a software license code (valid on all 
platforms) and instructions how to use it to turn off Evaluation-Mode 
(i.e. to remove the reminder after file transfers). This will work for 
all ZOC updates with the same major version numbers, e.g. all V5.xx version.

<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
When you buy the software, you will get free updates with the same major 
version numbre (e.g. all 6.xx versions). Starting with the 6.00 release 
there will be a succession of ZOC version which will contain bug fixes 
and minor improvements (like adding a few options, making a dialog easier 
to use or adding a file transfer protocol or terminal emulation) until 
a point is reached, where the program runs reasonably smooth and solid.&nbsp;</p><p> 
All these versions will have the same major version number 
and will hence be covered by the 6.xx software license code. Judging 
from our past versions, this point will probably be reached in the range 
of version 6.40.<br> 
After that point, there will be an upgrade with major improvements and that 
version will eventually be released as version V7.00. Users with a 6.xx 
license will then be offered an upgrade license at a reduced price 
(currently the 5.xx to 6.xx upgrade costs approx $20).

Since version 6.00, ZOC is available for Windows (Windows 2000 or later) and 
Mac OS X (10.4 Tiger). As far as the operating systems permit, the functions 
of ZOC are identical. Configuration files can be used for either platform and 
the license can be used for Windows or OS X.
