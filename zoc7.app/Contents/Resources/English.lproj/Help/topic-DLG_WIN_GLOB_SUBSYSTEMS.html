This block of options groups various connection types and emulations 
in order to tell the program loader how likely these are to be used. &nbsp;</p><p> 
<font color="5080A0"><i>Off</i></font> means that it is unlikely that you will use the functions. <font color="5080A0"><i>On</i></font> means that 
the function is one of your primarily used functions. The third state (neither on 
nor off) is somewhere in between (meaning that the feature will be used occasionally).&nbsp;</p><p> 
Depending on these settings, ZOC may delay the loading of functions 
and may not offer them in the <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_PHONE_QUICKCONNECT.html>Quick Connection</a> or 
other dialogs unless they have already been used. Please be aware that turning 
off a function off does not mean that it is strictly disabled. 
Think of it in terms of telling the likeliness of using the function 
in order to optimize loading the program's loading time and memory 
use.&nbsp;</p><p> 
ZOC may still load and offer such a function, if it has previously been used. 
If for example you have disabled the TN3270 emulation, but subsequently have 
a host directory entry, which has the TN3270 emulation selected, it will be still 
be loaded when you open the host directory.&nbsp;</p><p>
