<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Hide window while connecting via AutoConnect feature</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
If you do not want the large ZOC window on screen while using the AutoConnect 
(dial and retry) feature, you can select this option. In this case ZOC will 
hide while attempting to make the connection, just leaving the small 
dial progress window on the screen. The main window will come back after 
a connection was made (or finally failed). 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Bring window to front when connected</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
If set, the main window of ZOC will come to the top of all windows when 
a connection was made. This way you can have ZOC connect in the background and 
jump in if a connection attempt was successful. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Minimize window during file transfers</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
If you do not want the large ZOC window to be visible while a file transfer is 
going on, this options minimizes the ZOC's main window when starting the 
transfer so that only the transfer progress window remains on screen. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Bring window to front after a file transfer completed</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
If set, the main window of ZOC will come to the top of the desktop after 
a file transfer has been completed. This way you can put ZOC aside to 
do other work during a file transfer without missing the transfer's 
end.
