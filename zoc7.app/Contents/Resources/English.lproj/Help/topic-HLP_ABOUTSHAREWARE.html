<h2>About the Evaluation Version of ZOC</h2><p>

&nbsp;<br/><table class="hlbox" width="99%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr class="hlbox"><td class="hlbox"><b>General</b></td></tr></table><img src="dummy.gif" alt="nil" width="200" height="12" /><br/> 
ZOC is a commercial software product which you can try 
before you buy it. The trial is fully functional and you 
can use it for 30 days (in fact on 30 different days) to find out 
if you like the program and if its features meet your requirements. &nbsp;</p><p> 
After that time you should either <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_HOW2ORDER.html>order a license</a> 
or uninstall the program from your system. &nbsp;</p><p> 
&nbsp;</p><p> 
&nbsp;<br/><table class="hlbox" width="99%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr class="hlbox"><td class="hlbox"><b>Evaluation Mode</b></td></tr></table><img src="dummy.gif" alt="nil" width="200" height="12" /><br/> 
When the program displays the text <font color="5080A0"><i>evaluation mode</i></font> in 
the window title bar, it means that there is no licence code 
from a ZOC purchase on your computer. &nbsp;</p><p> 
This will obviously be the case when you are evaluating the software 
for the first time. It can also happen if someone installed 
the program on your computer and did not tell you that you need to 
purchase a license (amazingly this happens quite often).&nbsp;</p><p> 
If you did purchase ZOC, but see ZOC reporting evaluation mode, 
maybe you did not enter the license code which you received with 
the purchase. Or you reinstalled your system without reentering 
the code or you have a license code for an older version of ZOC.&nbsp;</p><p> 
If you are not sure why you are seeing the evaluation message, please 
do not hesitate to <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_CONTACT.html>contact our support</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>

&nbsp;<br/><table class="hlbox" width="99%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr class="hlbox"><td class="hlbox"><b>Restrictions in Evaluation Mode</b></td></tr></table><img src="dummy.gif" alt="nil" width="200" height="12" /><br/> 
There are no technical restrictions in evaluation mode, i.e. 
<font color="5080A0"><i>the evaluation version of ZOC is fully functional</i></font>. 
We did not disable any functions and everything that has to do 
with the evaluation period is clearly marked as such (for example 
you will see extra windows to remind you of the programs' 
evaluation status). &nbsp;</p><p> 
If something does not work the way you expect it, it is either by 
design, by misconfiguration or it may be caused by a program bug. 
In any case, you can <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_CONTACT.html>contact our support</a> during 
the evaluation period and we will do our best to solve the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>
