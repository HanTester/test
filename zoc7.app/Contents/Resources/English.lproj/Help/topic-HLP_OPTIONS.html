<h2>Customizing ZOC</h2><p>

&nbsp;</p><p>There are various types of options that allow the customization of ZOC 
on different levels: : <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_OPTIONS3.html>Program Options</a>, 
<a class="link" href=topic-HLP_OPTIONS2.html>Misc. Program Options</a> and 
<a class="link" href=topic-HLP_OPTIONS1.html>Session Options</a>. <br> 
Finally some customization can 
also occur through the <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_START_ZOCCFG.html>commandline.ini file</a>&nbsp;</p><p> 
Program options hardly change once you defined them. On the other hand, it is 
very likely that some other will differ between different hosts you use 
(these are called session profiles). Therefore, while there is only one set of 
program options, but you can have as many Session Profiles (containing options 
that are more likely to be session specific) as you like. &nbsp;</p><p> 
Session Profiles, Key Map Profiles, etc. are files which contain configurations, 
which may differ between connections. E.g. when connecting to a Linux web server 
and an IBM mainframe, you may want to have different sets of user buttons, 
different screen layout and cursor types. A session profile is a set of configuration 
parameters which can be assigned to a connection (session).&nbsp;</p><p> 
Additionally, when making connections through the Quick Connect dialog and 
Host Directory, you can specify a connection type and emulation and the options 
options for these. These will override the corresponding settings in the 
session profile. This provides a layered set of settings, that will let you 
use the same session profile (f-keys, user buttons, screen 
elements, etc.) on hosts which use slightly different connections and 
emulations.&nbsp;</p><p>
