<h2>Handling Fonts, Window Size, Colors</h2><p>

The text handling of a terminal emulation differs noticeably from 
a text processor. The topics below explain the way ZOC deals with 
the issues regarding fonts, window size and color.&nbsp;</p><p> 
&nbsp;<br/><table class="hlbox" width="99%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr class="hlbox"><td class="hlbox"><b>Fonts</b></td></tr></table><img src="dummy.gif" alt="nil" width="200" height="12" /><br/> 
Terminal emulations can only use fonts where all characters have 
the same width and height, i.e. where the letter <font class="example" color="207030" face="Courier New"><span class="example">i</span></font> has the 
width as the letter <font class="example" color="207030" face="Courier New"><span class="example">W</span></font>. This is necessary to display 
tables or indentations correctly. Under Windows this is true 
for the Lucida Console or Courier New fonts.&nbsp;</p><p> 
Additionally the host expects that certain 
characters are displayed when a certain code is sent to the terminal. 
For example some hosts send a code to display line graphic 
characters while others may send the same code to display a 
European language character. The mapping of characters to codes 
is defined in so called character sets. Most hosts either expect 
the Windows/Ansi/Latin or the IBM/DOS character set. &nbsp;</p><p> 
Fonts and character sets are configured in Options, 
<a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_LAYOUT.html>Session Profile, Layout</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> 
&nbsp;<br/><table class="hlbox" width="99%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr class="hlbox"><td class="hlbox"><b>Window Size</b></td></tr></table><img src="dummy.gif" alt="nil" width="200" height="12" /><br/> 
Most remote hosts display text in a fixed number of 
lines with a fixed number of characters per line. Usually 25 
lines of 80 characters are used (this may differ depending on the 
host and emulation). Together with the fact, that all characters 
in a font have the same width and height, this determines the 
screen space necessary to display the terminal area. 25 lines 
of 80 characters with a small font will take up less space than 
25 lines of 80 characters with a larger font. ZOC will adjust 
its window around the space which is necessary to display 
all lines and characters with a given font. This means 
that the size of the ZOC window depends on these factors. &nbsp;</p><p> 
The ways how font selection interacts with window sizing can 
be configured in Options, 
<a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_LAYOUT.html>Session Profile, Layout</a> and 
partly relies on the terminal size configuration in 
<a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_TERMINAL.html>Session Profile, Terminal Characteristics</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> 
&nbsp;<br/><table class="hlbox" width="99%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr class="hlbox"><td class="hlbox"><b>Colors</b></td></tr></table><img src="dummy.gif" alt="nil" width="200" height="12" /><br/> 
Most emulations work with a set of 16 base color (black, red, 
blue, green, ...). In Options, Session Profile, 
<a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_WINDOW.html>Window</a> you can select the colors, 
which ZOC will use for text and background. However, the text 
and background colors can be changed by the remote host (e.g. 
it may switch to yellow to display highlighted text). Remote 
hosts usually assume gray text on black background so the 
colors which the remote host selects, may or may not be good 
to read on your individual configuration. &nbsp;</p><p> 
In the window configuration it is also possible to change the 
16 base colors. When this is done, ZOC will display your selected 
color when the remote application requests one of the 16 base 
colors. Usually the global color table is only changed to modify 
the color tones of a given color, e.g. to make the standard green 
a bit brighter or dimmer or to give it a different tone of green. 
However, taking this to the extreme, it is also possible to select 
a completely different color, so that ZOC displays orange when 
the remote host requests green. Naturally this may lead to 
surprising results.&nbsp;</p><p> 
In the TN3270 and 5250 emulations, the text and background 
color settings are ignored. The reason for this is that these 
emulations work based on functional colors, i.e. the host will 
request highlight color, status color, message color, etc. from 
the terminal. Due to the vast number of combinations possible, 
ZOC comes with a selection of color schemes in which colors have 
been selected for good readability. You can select one of these 
color schemes for the 3270 and 5250 emulations in 
<a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_EMULATION.html>Session Profile, Emulation</a>. 
The color schemes are built from the 16 base colors, so it is 
possible to change them by changing the global color table 
in <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_OPTS_EMULATION.html>Session Profile, Window</a>
