<h2>Environment Variables</h2><p>

ZOC uses the TZ environment variable to correct the file date transmitted 
by Zmodem. 
&nbsp;</p><p>Zmodem was developed with Unix in mind, where time stamps (file date/time) 
are always stored in Greenwich time and where local time is calculated by the 
dir command. This way a file always carries the correct local time, even if 
shipped on disk around the globe. However, the HPFS file system knows 
nothing about the time zones which are still part of Zmodem. Most 
MS-DOS systems emulate the time zone in one way or another, mostly by using 
Eastern Standard Time (5 hours west of Greenwich) as a default; 
files received from such senders get the correct time when received by ZOC. 
However, some hosts use other time zones. If you want to adapt your 
time zone setting to such hosts, you should add the TZ environment 
variable to your CONFIG.SYS. 
&nbsp;</p><p>To do this use SET TZ=&lt;SSS&gt;&lt;N&gt;&lt;DDD&gt; 
where &lt;SSS&gt; is a 3-char standard time code, &lt;N&gt; is the time difference from 
Greenwich and &lt;DDD&gt; is a 3-char daylight saving time code, for example use 
SET TZ=EST5EDT for Eastern Standard Time (which is the default) or 
TZ=CET2CDT for Central European Time.
