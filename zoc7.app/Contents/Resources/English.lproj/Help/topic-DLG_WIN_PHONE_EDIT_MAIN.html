<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
A name for the entry. This name is shown in the host directory and it is used 
to set the title of the session's tab and it is shown in the main window's 
title when a connection is made. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Section</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Select the host directory section to store this entry to. The sections can 
be managed in <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_PHONE_OPTS.html>Host Directory Options</a>. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Icon</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
You can choose a colored icon for an entry. The entry will display the icon 
in the host directory and it will also use the icon for the ZOC window when 
a connection was made. The color of the icon will also determine the color 
of a session's tab in the main window. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Sort first in host directory list</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
The host directory can be sorted by clicking on the column headers in 
the host directory main window. This option is intended for important 
hosts and will keep the entry always sorted near the top of the list. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Connect to</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
The internet address, hostname or phone number of the host. The specifics 
depends on the connection type (see Connection type below). The 
<a class="link" href=topic-HLP_QUICKSTART.html>Quick Start Guides</a> will show you how to set 
up connections for SSH, Telnet, serial cables, etc.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
For <font color="5080A0"><i>Serial/Modem</i></font> connections you can use one or more of the 
host directory macros in this field. These can be used to insert 
strings for calling cards, etc. into the phone number 
(see <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_GLOB_AUTODIAL.html>Options&rarr;Program Settings&rarr;AutoConnect</a> 
options). 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Dial Command</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
If you are using <font color="5080A0"><i>Serial/Modem</i></font> as the connection type, you can select a dial 
command (from the <a class="link" href=topic-HLP_MODEMAT.html>Modem Options</a>) to be used to dial 
the phone number. 
<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Make Connection via...</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Here you choose if you want to use the AutoConnect feature (a connect 
window with retry option) or if you want to make the connection with 
a single attempt and no extra dialog (the latter behavior is similar to 
most standard command line tools like ssh or telnet).<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
The latter is useful for network based connections (SSH, Telnet, etc.) 
and it allows you to connect to multiple hosts at once by selecting 
multiple entries in the host directory main window and clicking <font color="5080A0"><i>Connect</i></font>. 
If the entries have the option set to open a new tab when 
connecting (see <a class="link" href=topic-DLG_WIN_PHONE_EDIT_NEWWIN.html>host directory entry Window options</a>), 
ZOC will open multiple tabs and concurrently connect to the hosts.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
If however the hosts are configured to connect via AutoConnect, ZOC will 
instead show one connect dialog and will try to connect to the first 
available destination. Further hosts can then be called with the 
<font color="5080A0"><i>Call Next</i></font> function from the File menu.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br>

<br/>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Session Profile</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Select the name of a session profile for use with the connection (e.g. 
<font color="5080A0"><i>Standard.zoc</i></font> or <font color="5080A0"><i>TN3270.ZOC</i></font>). Session profiles are preconfigured 
sets of settings (Fonts, Colors, Keys, Terminal behavior, etc) that can be shared 
among multiple connections which need similar options.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
This way you can have entirely different options for different hosts or you can 
use the same options for a group of similar hosts. New options files can 
be created by editing one of the profiles and using the <font color="5080A0"><i>Save As</i></font> button 
in the session profile dialog.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
After the file was loaded, the connection method, emulation, file transfer 
protocol and code page will be set from the settings in this host directory 
entry, i.e. if necessary these options from the host directory entry can 
override the corresponding settings in the session profile.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br>

<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Connection type (Device)</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
This field lets you specify a communication method to make the connection.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
For the selected connection type you will be able to configure 
that communication type, by clicking the <font color="5080A0"><i>Configure</i></font> button next to it. 
For example with Secure Shell you can set different encryption methods for 
different hosts in your host directory. The settings dialog will vary with 
the selected connection methods.<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
The selection and options can override the selection of connection type 
and its settings in the session profile (the session profile to 
use with this connection is specified further up in this dialog).<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br>

<tr><td class="pthead1" colspan=2><b>Emulation</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ptindent1">&nbsp;</td>	 <td class="ptbody1"> 
Select an emulation to use for the connection. 
The button next to the emulation list lets you change options which are 
specific to each emulation. <br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br> 
The choice of emulation and its options can override the emulation selection 
and its settings for that emulation in session profile (the session profile to 
use with this connection is specified further up in this dialog).<br><img src='dummy.gif' border='0' width='8' height='8' /><br>
