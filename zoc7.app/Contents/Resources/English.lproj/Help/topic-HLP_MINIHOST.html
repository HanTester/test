<h2>MINIHOST</h2><p>

Together with ZOC comes a MINIHOST program (implemented in ZOC's REXX 
script language). It offers a simple file exchange host. A typical 
use for it could be leaving it running on your home machine while 
you are away to the office, to make sure that you can download files 
from the home machine during the day if the need arises. Or you could 
use it to allow a friend to upload a report for review or whatever. 
Of course, the host program leaves much open (things like leaving 
messages etc.) but is partly designed as a complex example for REXX 
programming and partly as a point to start your own development. 
In any case, if you want to run a full fledged BBS it is highly 
recommended that you use a real BBS program. 
&nbsp;</p><p> 
By default, MINIHOST can be started from the user button bar, but 
you can also start MINIHOST.ZRX via Start-Script function from the Script menu. 
The program will come up with the question if you want to test it locally 
or not (ie. if you want to offer a connection via modem). Then it 
waits for a connection and asks for username and password. 
ADMIN/SECRET and GUEST/GUEST are predefined values.&nbsp;</p><p> 
To allow other users access to your machine, you must edit the 
MINIHOST.ZRX file (use Edit-Script from the Script menu) and modify the user 
entries in the upper part of the program. For each user you can 
select a username, a password, a home directory and a mode. Mode 0 
restricts access to the assigned home directory (which you need to 
create) on the drive that is defined on top of the userlist, 
while mode 1 allows access to all disks.
